## Description
Unlock the power of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and learn how to apply this cutting-edge algorithm to real-world business challenges! In this hands-on course, we’ll take you from the foundational theory of Monte Carlo simulations to advanced MCTS implementations, all in Python.

What makes MCTS truly practical is its versatility. Whether you're optimizing supply chain logistics, scheduling complex tasks, enhancing game AI, or making strategic business decisions under uncertainty, MCTS shines where traditional algorithms struggle. Its ability to balance exploration and exploitation makes it perfect for solving problems with large, dynamic, and unpredictable environments—just like in real-world business scenarios.

You’ll start with the basics—understanding Monte Carlo simulations and Python coding strategies. Then, we’ll dive deep into tree search algorithms like BFS and DFS, setting the stage for mastering MCTS. Through step-by-step coding sessions, you'll implement key MCTS components: rollout, selection, expansion, and backpropagation.

But we don’t stop at theory. You’ll solve practical business problems, including job shop scheduling, using MCTS with real-world data. We’ll guide you through designing code structures, optimizing performance, and analyzing results effectively.

By the end of this course, you'll not only understand how MCTS works but also how to apply it confidently to complex decision-making problems.

## Who this course is for:
Applied Data scientists who are dealing with solving real-world problems.
Researchers who want to apply MCTS or combine their approach with MCTS.
Game developers who want to learn one of the most required algorithms for game development.
Operations research scientists who want to add new, yet powerful weapon to their optimization arsenal.
Planning and Scheduling Specialists who want to apply simple yet efficient algorithm to solve their daily complex planning tasks
